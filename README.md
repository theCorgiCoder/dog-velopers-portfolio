## About the Project

We were tasked with building a responsive website with a focus on design and UX. We challenged ourselves
by using functions in CSS to help reduce the amount media queries for responsiveness. We used a small
amount of JS to create a hamburger menu in the mobile view. Overall we had a blast creating a fun
portfolio about our bestest boi's.
